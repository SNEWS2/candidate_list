## **Work in progress**
## **THE FINAL VERSION OF RSG LIST IS NOT PUBLISHED**


# Galactic Supermassive Stars

Currently only version 1-3 of the RSG list is completed however other supermassive star list with less rigorous analysis will be upload for Wolf-Rayet and other supermassive stars

## Content
- `RSG_version_1.csv` : First version of RSG candidate list used for SNEWS, includes anyalsis on luminosity and likelyhood of being a RSG
   - Regions for likelihood of RSG status include: 
      - **Gold** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space which should be almost complete RSGs
      - **Silver** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space which has some AGB contaimination
      - **Bronze** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space with progressive more AGB contaimination
- `RSG_version_2.csv` : Second version which includes expansion of list through Method 2, new derivation for dust extiniction, and changes to how spectral type was adopted
- `RSG_version_3.csv` : Third version which includes uncertainties for calculated values, addition of Simbad classifications and Absolute G mag
   - was released here first rather then to SNEWS internally 
- `Blue_supermassive_stars.csv` : Compliation file of Blue supermassive stars from literature 
  - does not include any further anaylsis 
  - to be uploaded
- `yellow-supermassive_stars.csv`: Compliation file of Yellow supermassive stars from literature 
  - does not include any further anaylsis
  - to be uploaded
-  `supermassive_stars.csv`: Compliation file of supermassive stars whose color has not been classified but have been determined as a massive star 
   - does not include any further anaylsis
   - to be uploaded
- `wolf_rayet_stars.csv`: Compliation file of Wolf-Rayet stars from literature
  - does not include any further anaylsis
  - to be uploaded
- `python_file` :
  - code for basic manipulation of the files listed above
  - to be uploaded
