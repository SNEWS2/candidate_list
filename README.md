# Galactic RSGs
- `Final_RSG_close_stars_Catalog_7_21_2023`:
    -Final list containing both methods and all stars printed in the recent paper (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.08785)
    - includes close star list
- `Final_RSG_Catalog_7_21_2023`:
    -Final list containing both methods and all stars printed in the recent paper (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.08785)
    - does not include close star list
- `Method_1_RSGs_catalog.csv`: 
   - portion of the final version based on a collection of literature 

- `RSG_version_2.csv`: Second version which includes expansion of list through Method 2, new derivation for dust extinction, and changes to how spectral type was adopted
   
- `RSG_version_1.csv`: First version of RSG candidate list used for SNEWS, includes analysis on luminosity and the likelihood of being an RSG
   - Regions for the likelihood of RSG status include: 
      - **Gold** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space which should be almost complete RSGs
      - **Silver** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space which has some AGB contamination
      - **Bronze** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space with progressive more AGB contamination
