   - to be uploaded
   - Regions for likelihood of RSG status include: 
      - **Gold** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space which should be almost complete RSGs
      - **Silver** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space which has some AGB contaimination
      - **Bronze** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space with progressive more AGB contaimination
- `RSG_version_2.csv` : second version which includes expansion of list and changes to method for adopting spectral type
  - to be uploaded
- `Blue_supermassive_stars.csv` : compliation file of Blue supermassive stars from literature, does not include any further anaylsis 
  - to be uploaded
- `yellow-supermassive_stars.csv`: compliation file of Yellow supermassive stars from literature, does not include any further anaylsis
