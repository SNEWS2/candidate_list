## **THE FINAL VERSION OF RSG LIST IS NOT YET PUBLISHED**
Currently only version 1-2 of the RSG list is completed. Other massive star list will also be upload for Wolf-Rayet and other stars in near future.

# Galactic RSGs
**Work in progress!** Currently only version 1-2 of the RSG list is completed.

- `RSG_version_2.csv` : Second version which includes expansion of list through Method 2, new derivation for dust extiniction, and changes to how spectral type was adopted
   - Some stars dropped out due to...
- `RSG_version_1.csv` : First version of RSG candidate list used for SNEWS, includes anyalsis on luminosity and likelyhood of being a RSG
   - Regions for likelihood of RSG status include: 
      - **Gold** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space which should be almost complete RSGs
      - **Silver** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space which has some AGB contaimination
      - **Bronze** - in an area of Luminosity/Effective Temperature space with progressive more AGB contaimination
